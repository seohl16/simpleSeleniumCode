really simple Selenium crawling code using chromedriver

1. chromedriver should be in the current working directory (otherwise change the path ./chromedriver_mac )
2. chromedriver should be downloaded according to OS (mine, mac)
3. if the chromedriver does not work, try.. 
```
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine chromedriver_mac
```
4. fix the URL for your project (url = "https://naver.com)
5. execute 
```
python3 SimpleSelenium.py
```
